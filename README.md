# Brain Games

Brain Games is a set of five console games based on popular mobile brain training apps. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, it is considered that the game is over. Incorrect answers end the game and offer to go through it again. Games are:

- Brain-even. Determining an even number.
- Brain-calc. Arithmetic expressions that need to be calculated.
- Brain-gcd. Determination of the greatest common divisor.
- Brain-progression. Finding missing numbers in a sequence of numbers.
- Brain-prime. Determination of a prime number.
